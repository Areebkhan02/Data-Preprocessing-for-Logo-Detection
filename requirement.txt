now I have an excel file with 2 columns:
1) labels 
2) file_name

some examples are like this:
35	5f8c8d4c0297181ab3e6910a_795.txt
35	5f8c8d4c0297181ab3e6910a_491.txt
29	63e2f78ed84f683605300887_423.txt
29	63c9f491ca7224dec69376df_435.txt
29	63a154c2066286f9f34e8c9a_175.txt

now what I want is that I would give to the function
1) images folder name 
2) labels folder name 
3) class label 
4) number of images to delete 

the script should see first like make a dictionary against the class label name which stores the names of the txts that are unique ( this information is in the excel file)
then shuffles them randomly like alot then deletes the images from the labels folder and the images folder. The amount of images to delete user will give
